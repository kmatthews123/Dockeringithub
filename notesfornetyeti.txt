Notes on docker 

open new project in codespaces
 - how do you do that, I got some screenshots showing how to do that. Will include these.

add extensions, maybe show a little picture of the extension logo?

for adding docker files to codespace you should add that you can use the command listed below or generate them manualy
adding that you can do this with "Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace"

I got hung up with two = signs in the requirements .txt thing but aside from that wstuff worked

the docker compose run -rm seems to want one more arg. not sure what to put in there based on the document. 

may want to make sure people know how to get into the terminal


going to add stuff 
 - dev container and cicd and making it your own

30 minutse to make plus q&A
